              Hello everyone! My name is Illia. Today I want to tell you about
              an interesting theme, which calls Server-Side Rendering using
              Next.JS. Before we start, I want to tell you about what the SPA
              is.

                  SPA is a web application or a website that uses only
                  HTML-document as a wrapper for all web pages and organizes
                  interaction with users through dynamically downloaded HTML /
                  CSS / JS with AJAX without a page reloading.

                  Nowadays a lot of browsers request only data from the server
                  and HTML generates on the client-side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That is, instead of sending a new request to the server for
                  getting an HTML page, we are creating HTML from the
                  client-side, mounting new components, and requesting data that
                  needs for the filling of HTML itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this way, we propagate full reloading for the web page and
                  greatly improve page time-loading.

              There're some interesting solutions, but we want to pay attention

              <p>
                We need to have a server
              that runs our application in the same way as the user did in the
              browser.
              </p> 
              <p>
                The server sends to the client fulfilled HTML and needed
              JS / CSS files etc.
              </p> When the client receives HTML and resources,
              it synchronizes the state of the application and works with it
              like with the usual SPA For its description, we need to figure out
              some nuances: the application divides into a client and a server
              the server has to handle requests to the API with the data; these
              operations are asynchronous === Side Effects At the client, our
              application has to synchronize the state and continues to work as
              a regular SPA - application Let's pay attention to the other
              features:

                 An important aspect with the SSR -

                  For caching
                the session files, we use cookies instead of localStorage. These
                files send automatically with every request. Some data have to

                server and issuing a ready-made JSON React tree.

                 The debugging at the server executes the same way as
                every debug Node.JS application through Inspect. So we need to
                include into the webpack.config the "devtool: source-map"
                setting.

                React Router uses the SSR for the box solution. The
                difference is that the server uses the StaticRouter with the
                passed current URL, but the client - Router defines the URL
                automatically with the location API.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  The advantage of using SSR is that we have an application and
                  its content can be seen with bundler, even if it can't execute
                  the JS - code. It can help SEO and send the metadata to the
                  canals of social media.
